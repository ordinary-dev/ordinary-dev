### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Ivan Reshetnikov.

- In my projects I use:

![Python](icons/python.svg)
![Docker](icons/docker.svg)
![TypeScript](icons/typescript.svg)
![React](icons/react.svg)
![Next JS](icons/next-js.svg)

- I maintain sites that were developed as part of the [Alt Web](https://github.com/alt-web) project.

- I have [a game](https://github.com/pixeltrain/student-quest), you can play it at your own risk. I am currently developing [the next game](https://github.com/pixeltrain/btw). Any help is welcome.
