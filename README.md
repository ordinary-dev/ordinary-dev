### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Ivan Reshetnikov and I'm a full stack developer.
- I use Golang and Typescript most often, but I also sometimes use Rust or Python.
- I maintain my own [Mastodon](https://m.comfycamp.space) and Matrix server, everything works on Nixos.

I have a few projects on Forgejo. Github is not the only place where I post my code.

- [Comfycamp](https://git.comfycamp.space/lumin/comfycamp) - my personal website.
- [Histd](https://git.comfycamp.space/lumin/histd) - a desktop note taking application, that allows you to quickly describe the current day.
- [My-solutions](https://git.comfycamp.space/lumin/my-solutions) - my solutions to various programming problems.
- [Ordinary-neovim](https://git.comfycamp.space/lumin/ordinary-neovim) - minimal neovim configuration for coding written in lua.
